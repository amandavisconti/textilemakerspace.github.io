A faulty water fountain on the 3rd floor of Pigott Hall led to collapsed ceiling tiles on the 1st floor of the building, including the newly-renamed Textile Makerspace Annex AKA Quinn's office. The 1960's LeClerc Mira loom, which had barely been in the room for a week, bore the brunt of the mushy ceiling tiles, but thanks to some quick work and advocacy on the part of DLCL facilities manager John Richardson, we don't expect it will sustain significant permanent damage.  Many thanks, too, to the making@stanford folks who came over to lend a hand with saving the loom!
