The Textile Makerspace is staffed by DLCL Academic Technology Specialist Quinn Dombrowski and a group of volunteers. The schedule can vary, but we try to keep the latest info about our open hours on this page. If you'd like to volunteer to help run the Textile Makerspace, please [contact us](contact)!
