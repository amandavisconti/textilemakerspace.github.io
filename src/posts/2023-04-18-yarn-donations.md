An incredible donation of many boxes of yarn brought together Textile Makerspace staff and visitors for a yarn party. Mary Prada Dombrowski delighted students with a gorgeous and diverse assortment of yarns, which were immediately put to good use through knitting and crochet projects. These special yarns are in their own plastic tubs in the Makerspace, and all are welcome to use them -- just send Quinn a picture of what you make, so our generous donor can enjoy them.
