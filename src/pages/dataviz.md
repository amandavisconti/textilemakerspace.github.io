The Textile Makerspace is the location for *DLCL 203: Data Visualization with Textiles*, a 1-credit independent study that gives students the opportunity to learn and practice a variety of textile methods, and consider different ways of applying them to visualizing data.

Here's some examples of textile data visualization:

* Quinn's [PhD quilt wall hanging](/phdquilt/)
* Kelsey Dufresne + Mary Downs's [QR code quilt](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b2cee67bac6b42d9b95b5e7e9defebb2)
