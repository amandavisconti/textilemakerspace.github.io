On October 11th, the Textile Makerspace had a station at the Stanford Libraries [Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Fair](https://events.stanford.edu/event/justice_equity_diversity_and_inclusion_jedi_fair_8413), with the guestbook loom giving visitors a place to express how they were feeling.
