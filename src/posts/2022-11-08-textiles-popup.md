On November 8th, the Textile Makerspace held a hands-on pop-up event as part of Stanford Libraries [Special, Unique and Rare: Textiles and Fashion](https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2022/10/special-unique-and-rare-textiles-and-fashion-nov-8) event in Hohbach Hall.

We brought perler beads and had patterns from vintage weaving manuals on hand, giving participants a chance to recreate the weaving patterns (or anything else they'd like) through the medium of perler beads.
