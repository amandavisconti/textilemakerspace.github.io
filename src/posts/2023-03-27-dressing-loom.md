This month's [Special, Unique, and Rare exhibit](https://library.stanford.edu/exhibitions/special-unique-and-rare-food-green-library-hohbach-hall) at the Library had the theme of food, so the Textile Makerspace hosted a hands-on activity for needle felting food (or anything else).

Staff and grad students alike seemed to find needle felting to be a pleasingly cathartic craft activity!
