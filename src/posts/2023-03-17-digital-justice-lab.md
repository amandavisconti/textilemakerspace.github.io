As part of a retreat for the [Data-Sitters Club](http://datasittersclub.github.io/site), Textile Makerspace director Quinn Dombrowski visited Prof. Jacque Wernimont's [Digital Justice Lab](https://digitaljusticelab.com/about/) at Dartmouth, and was inspired by Molly Morin's [KnitLab](https://mollymorin.com/knitlab/) project there. A KH-940 digital knitting machine may be coming soon to the Textile Makerspace.
