The Textile Makerspace participated in the Love Data Week Fair on Valentine's Day, with a station dedicated to textiles and data. As part of the event, we surveyed library staff, followers on Mastodon and on Twitter, and people who attended the event in-person on their feeling about data. At the end of the event, we knitted everyone's results from a yarn "data ball" into a "data scarf".

Several of the CIDR staff who helped run the station were wearing matching shirts with Data from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, sewed together at the Textile Makerspace. Stanford Digital Repository staff also handed out Valentines created at the Textile Makerspace using our Cricut Make.
