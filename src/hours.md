The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff. The schedule can vary, but we try to keep the latest info about our open hours on this page.

## Spring break schedule

Pigott Hall is closed for spring break, but we'll have the Makerspace open for a few hours while Quinn is around. Text Quinn at 773-369-7688 when you get to the building to be let in.

- Monday 3/27, 2:30-6:30 PM
- Thursday 3/30, TBD sometime 8 AM - 4 PM possibly with breaks? Email qad@stanford.edu if you want to come by Thursday and we can figure something out.
