Hello, I was named Noah because I survived the Great Third Floor Water Fountain Flood in Pigott Hall shortly after arriving here. I'm a ~1960's vintage LeClerc Mira counterbalance loom.

## Supplies

I'm still getting set up, but I'll likely end up using a ton of warp thread along with a lot of yarn.

## Fun facts

I'm actually wider than the Makerspace Annex door, so I had to be partially disassembled to make it into the room. Suffice it to say, I don't plan on going anywhere ever.
