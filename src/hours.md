The schedule can vary, but we try to keep the latest info about our open hours on this page. If you'd like to volunteer to help run the Textile Makerspace, please [contact us](contact)!

Come join us next Tuesday, November 8, from 2-4pm in the Hohbach Seminar Room (126) to see what we've selected relating to TEXTILES and FASHION! 

How have fashion and textiles been used throughout history by people to express themselves, advance technology, influence labor practices, and make political statements? We'll have examples from around the world - stop by to be inspired!

## Fall 2022 schedule

We're still figuring out our regular open hours, and applying for funding to hire a student assistant (possibly as soon as winter)!
