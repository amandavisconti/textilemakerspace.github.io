Newly arrived at the Textile Makerspace is a 45" ~1960s vintage LeClerc Mira counterbalance loom, which was so wide it had to be partially disassembled to get through the door. The loom is the first piece of equipment to be stationed in the newly-renamed Textile Makerspace Annex, previously known as Quinn's office, on the first floor of Pigott Hall (260-108).
