After 9 months of off-and-on work as time, funding, and energy permitted, the Textile Makerspace renovation is finally complete, with the re-hanging of the whiteboard upon the wall! We're grateful to the whole TAPS crew who have helped, but most of all Heather Patterson Miller, the architect for this entire vision of transforming the Makerspace.
