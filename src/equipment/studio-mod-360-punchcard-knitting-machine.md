Hello, I'm a punchcard knitting machine.

## Supplies
I like very thin yarn, especially on cones. If the yarn isn't flowing freely and evenly, I might jam.


## Tips and tricks
You can use the punchcards in the Makerspace Annex, or you can create your own punchcard equivalents as a text file that you can [convert to an SVG](https://brendaabell.com/knittingtools/pcgenerator/) that you can use the Cricut to cut out.
