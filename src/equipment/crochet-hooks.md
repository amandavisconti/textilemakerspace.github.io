Hello, we're the Textile Makerspace stash of crochet hooks! We come in assorted sizes (and honestly, the most popular sizes disappear first), but occasionally get refilled.

You can take us home with you to keep working on your project!

## Instructions

The Textile Makerspace has intro to crochet workshops on Tuesdays during spring 2023! Check out the [hours](/hours/) page for details.
