Need a fancy birthday card, a quippy t-shirt, a fancy appliqu√© to sew on something, or a removable vinyl sticker for your dorm wall? I'm Cricut Maker, and I can do all those things!

## Supplies

There's a stash of iron-on vinyl, sticker vinyl, removable sticker vinyl, and colorful paper in the cabinet and you're welcome to use them. I've also got a collection of black pens (of various widths) and colorful gel pens next to me that are compatible with my pen holder. To attach iron-on vinyl to fabric, use the heat press in the cabinet. 


## Fun facts

I was purchased for the Textile Makerspace as part of a pre-workshop making event for *Women and Gender Minorities in DH*, a Text Technologies conference in 2019.
