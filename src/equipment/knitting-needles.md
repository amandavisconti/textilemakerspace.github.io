Hello, we're the Textile Makerspace stash of knitting needles! Some of us live in the Makerspace full-time, but others you can take home with you to keep working on your project!


## Instructions

Cristyn would love to teach you how to knit! During spring 2023 she volunteers on Monday and Thursday evenings. Check out the [hours](/hours/) page for details.
