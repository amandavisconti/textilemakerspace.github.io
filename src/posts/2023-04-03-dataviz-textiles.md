Spring quarter kicks off the first-ever class of DLCL 203: Data Visualization with Textiles. In this independent study, students can come by the Textile Makerspace during any of its open hours to learn from staff (or practice on their own) textile-related tools and methods, with the goal of creating a project that incorporates data in some way.

Quinn's experimental project will be to create a toy data set of transcribed and annotated *Calvin and Hobbes* comics, looking at different ways to visualize that data in yarn.
