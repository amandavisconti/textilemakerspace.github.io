Want to make a bookmark or a special patch pocket? Take one of us personal looms with you! It's true, we came in a kit designed for elementary school students, but there's no age limit on weaving.

## Supplies

You can use whatever you want to create our *warp* (the vertical threads you weave between), including yarn or the warp thread also used with the standing loom. Then you can use anything -- yarn, fabric strips, paper, rubber bands -- to go over and under the warp threads, in the opposite pattern of the previous yarn/string/etc.
