We are excited to share the news that the Textile Makerspace has received one of the pilot making@stanford grants, as part of a joint proposal with *Miller Makers* (at the Hopkins Marine Station) and the *Terman MakerBar* (in the engineering library)! We intend to use most of the funds to hire student staff to help keep the Makerspace open more hours, and more student-friendly hours.
